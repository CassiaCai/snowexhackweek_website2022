    "[UAVSAR](https://uavsar.jpl.nasa.gov/education/what-is-uavsar.html) is a low frequency plane-based synthetic aperature radar. UAVSAR stands for \"Uninhabited Aeriel Vehicle Synthetic Aperature Radar\". It captures imagery using a L-band radar. This low frequency means it can penetrate into and through clouds, vegetation, and snow.\n",

    "L-band radar imagery penetrates through the snowpack. However when it crosses into the snowpack from the air it refracts at an angle, similar to light entering water. This refraction leads to a phase shift relative to an image with no or less snow. Using this difference in phase between two images we can calculate the change in snow height between flights using:\n",
