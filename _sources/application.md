# Application

We are glad you are interested in applying to participate in {{hackweek}}! 

## Selection Considerations

Hackweeks are participant-driven events that encourage collaboration and teamwork. We welcome people from a diverse range of career stages, experience levels, backgrounds and identities.

Participant selection will be made with the goal of enhancing the diversity of our communities and building lasting connections that foster open science and data sharing. Applicants are encouraged to share in writing how they resonate with our [hackweek mission](mission), and how they have committed to understanding and aiding in the pursuit of equity, inclusion and diversity. We will conduct a blind review of participant responses and apply a standardized metric.

Our events are often over-subscribed so we ask that you ensure you can attend the majority of our sessions during {{dates}} before applying.
